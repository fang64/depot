 <p>This document describes the quickest way to get depot to work for
you. This document is most useful if you are already familiar with
depot and want a streamlined view of the release process.

 </p><p>If you are not using an Andrew Workstation for set up please consult
the External-Setup.txt document, otherwise please see the
Andrew-Setup.txt document.

 </p><p>For instructions on how to take advantage of the features of
depot, please refer to the Using-Depot.txt document.

</p><h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>

  <p></p><li> Decide on where you want to store collections. The default
way is to store them in the "depot" directory of the environment
(e.g. /usr/local/depot).

<p>Collections are defined as directories which contain the files and
directories of an application. A collection name is defined as the
name of the directory housing the collection.

 </p><p></p></li><li>Create a depot.pref in the depot directory. If you chose the
default location listed above,  in the depot.pref put the following
line:
<pre>		searchpath * depot
</pre>
This tells depot to look in the depot directory for collections.

 <p></p></li><li><i>[optional]</i> Use the program fsi_generate to create the
"depot.image" file which contains all the stat(2) information of a
collection. This speeds up depot runs because depot does not have to
scan the collection; it can just read the file.

To do this, execute the command:
<pre>	% fsi_generate collection_path &gt; collection_path/depot.image
</pre>
where collection_dir is the path to the collection. e.g.
<pre>	% fsi_generate x11r5 &gt; x11r5/depot.image
</pre>

 <p>NOTE: If you use the depot.image file then you must keep it up to
date because depot only reads this file and does not look in the
collection.

 </p><p></p></li><li><i>[optional]</i> Generate hints to speed things up even more. The hints
aid in locating the collections to be added and REQUIRE that a
depot.image file be generated. To create the hint database, execute
the following command:
<pre>	% hintservice -set depotdir/depot.hint -image collection_path/depot.image collection_path
</pre>
 where "depotdir" is the directory to the depot directory and
collection_path is the path to the collection. e.g.
<pre>	% hintservice -set depot.hint -image x11r5/depot.image x11r5
</pre>


 <p></p></li><li>Run depot. Use the command:
<pre>	depot -T environment -v
</pre>
   where "environment" is the environment to be updated. e.g.
<pre>	depot -T /usr/local -v
</pre>
</li></ol>
