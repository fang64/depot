Q: What has changed between depot v4 and depot v5?
 <br>A:The <a href="NewToV5.html">NewToV5</a> document describes this.

 <hr>
Q: /usr/local is its own partition. How do I keep depot from blowing
away lost+found? 
 <br>A: Put this in the depot.pref:
<pre>
	specialfile lost+found
</pre>

 <hr>
Q: I'm getting syntax errors in my depot.pref and everything looks
right to me.
 <br>A: Check for colons in the preference options. Depot v5 no longer
uses colons as separators.

 <hr>
Q: What's the difference between "path" and "searchpath"?
<br>
A: The "path" preference points to the top level of a directory
hierarchy. In the following directory hierarchy:
<pre>
	.../before/foo/
	.../before/foo/bin
	.../before/foo/lib
</pre>
the path preference would be set to:
<pre>
	path foo .../before/foo
</pre>
"Searchpath" goes up one level and it takes all the directories as
collections. E.g. using the example above, it would be:
<pre>
	searchpath * .../before
</pre>

 <hr>
Q: How do I "hide" a directory?
 <br>A: You can use ~delete to keep a file or directory from being exported
to the target directory. If you want every collection to have this
behavior, put the following into the global depot.conf:
<pre>
	* ~delete &lt;dir&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;dir&gt; is the directory to be deleted.

Q: When my machine reboots, all the collections in /usr/local/depot
are removed. How do I keep this from happening?
 <br>A: <i>Package</i> will remove any unspecified files in this directory. To
protect these files you need to define the directories in your <i>package</i>
configuration file. For example:
<pre>
	D /usr/local/depot/foobie
</pre>
 Refer to the package documentation for more details.

 <hr>
Q: What is the difference between Depot with AFS and Depot without AFS?
 <br>A: All AFS is used for in Depot is to help determine the last
modification time of a collection. If AFS support is enabled, then the
fsi_generate and hintservice programs will query the last modification
time of the volume and use that to determine whether or not a
collection has been updated since the last run.
