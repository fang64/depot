<h1>The Depot Configuration<br>Management Project</h1></center>
<hr>

The Depot Project is the Unix System Configuration Management
component of the <a href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/ANDREWII/hostconfig.april.html">Workstation
Administration/Host Configuration</a> Andrew II project.  

<p>Depot is a software management tool providing a simple yet
flexible mechanism for maintaining third party and locally developed
software in large heterogeneous computing environments. Depot
integrates separately maintained software packages, known as
collections, into a common directory hierarchy consisting of a union
of all the collections. This common directory is defined as the
software environment. A set of configuration options manages
interactions and intersections between collections in the environment.

<p> More information on Depot and how Depot is used can be found by
taking a look at the <b><a href="doc-over.html">overview
papers</a></b>.

<p>The current version of Depot is v5. This version is incompatible
with the previous major release of Depot though many of the concepts
are the same. The file <a href="NewToV5.html">NewToV5</a>
provides an overview of the major changes.

<p>Depot v5 is currently in use by the Andrew project and the School
of Computer Science within CMU as well as many organizations outside
of CMU.

<p>The infrastructure required to support Depot is handled by the
Environment Maintenance Tool (<a href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/emt/emt.html">EMT</a>). This
tool automates the creation, release, and removal of the collection
areas used by Depot.<p>
