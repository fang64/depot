This is a list of known defects with depot and dpp. The first part of
each item is the defect tracking number. 

 <p>Feature requests are not included in this list.

<h2>Depot</h2>
<bl>
<h3>depot.pref Issues</h3>
<li>  940802-003 - If the ignore statement in the depot.pref is given
items separated by white space rather than commas, depot will go into
an infinite loop.

 <p> <li> 940831-003 - the target.owner/target.group depot.pref
options do not set the directory. They only set files within a
directory. There is no known workaround.

 <p> <li> 940831-003 - the target.owner/target.group depot.pref
options do not set the directory. They only set files within a
directory. There is no known workaround.

 <p> <li> 950220-001 - collection.installmethod will work only with
copy or link. 

<h3>Runtime Issues</h3>

 <p> <li> 941130-002 - If the modes on a copied file changes but the
modification time doesn, the modes are not updated on the files. The
workaround is to 'touch' the changed file, thereby changing the
modification time. 

 <p>
<li> 940518-017 - There is a core leak in the LEX/YACC code.

 <p> <li> 940518-015 - The user is not warned if there are duplicate
preference options (which may result in weird/unexpected behavior).

<p> <li>  950303-001 - Invalid hints genereate odd to bad behavior
with non-intuitive error messages.  
</bl>
 <p><p>
<h2>Dpp</h2>

 <p> <li> 941010-002 - the ~deletecommand depot.conf option is not
properly processed. If included in the depot.conf.proto, it will be
silently discarded and never make it into the final depot.conf. There
is no workaround.

<p> <li> 950303-002 - searchpath &lt;collection&gt; doesn't work right
