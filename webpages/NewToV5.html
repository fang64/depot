<h1>Changes From Depot Version 4 to Version 5</h1>
<hr>

<ol>
<li>Files renamed
<ul>
	struct.depot -&gt; depot.db
<br>
	custom.depot -&gt; depot.pref
</ul>

 <p>
<li>Files added
 <ul> depot.conf - an environment wide depot.conf (this exists in the
depot sub-directory)
 </ul>

 <p>
<li>Defaults changed
<ul>
 <li>The default targetdir is now '.' as opposed to '..'.
Specifically, this means that running depot in the depot subdirectory
no longer works.

<li>A depot.pref file must exist. Previously depot could run without a
custom.depot file being present.
 </ul>

 <p>
<li>Quick mode is quicker (but less consistent)
 <ul> If -Q is used, then it does not check the target directory. This
means that (1) unmapped files aren't removed and (2) invalid links may
result in depot hanging.
 </ul>

 <p>
<li> The command syntax has changed. See the "Using Depot"  for details.

 <p>
<li> Filters 
 <ul>
When installing files from a collection, it used to be
that you could either copy or link the file. Now, you can pass the
file through a "filter." For example, you could store all the files in
a collection as compressed files and the "filter" used to install the
files would be uncompress. See "Using Depot" for details.
 </ul>

<p>
<li> Command line
<ul>
Collections to be updated are no longer specified on the command line
or via the -f switch. All collections specified by the 'path' or
'searchpath' preference option will be processed.
</ol>
