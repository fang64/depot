# Carnagie Mellon University - Depot Sources

I would like to get as many versions archived to github but it's likely I wont be able to find them. If you have other versions feel free to PR to this repository. Since Depot was mostly used by OpenAFS, it's unlikely many would have it or even have a use for it.

It seems in my time of not messing with OpenAFS alot of resources related to it have vanished into thin air. 

UPDATE: I found an archive of the ftp.andrew.cmu.edu on archive.org that contained historical files, if anyone stumbles upon this looking for this stuff.

This is the URL paths they were referencing within the ftp server. Fortunately CMU decided to publish a http version of the ftp server so we have it archived.
