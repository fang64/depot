# Carnagie Mellon University - Depot Sources

I would like to get as many versions archived to github but it's likely I wont be able to find them. If you have other versions feel free to PR to this repository. Since Depot was mostly used by OpenAFS, it's unlikely many would have it or even have a use for it.

It seems in my time of not messing with OpenAFS alot of resources related to it have vanished into thin air.
